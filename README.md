Tapster v0.1

Alex Brewer

This is a web interface for the OpenBeerDatabase API.

Step-by-step run instructions:

Restart your apache server (not necessary, but I just like to do it).

#/etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Clone repo into the root of your web directory (something like /var/www/html/)

#git clone git://github.com/ATheringer/Tapster/

Open the landing page beer.html (using your preferred browser - I use firefox)

#firefox beer.html 

That's it! It should make simple queries now - more functionality (such as a login) will be added later. Let me know if there are any issues.
